# Invoicer (BETA)

Invoicer is a program that will help you with your invoices

## Installation

```
$> go get github.com/xescugc/invoicer
```

## Usage

You can use the `invoicer -h` to get the full help, but the main resources are:

* `user`: Your information
* `customers`: Your customers information
* `invoices`: Your invoices to the customers
* `templates`: Templates to use to print the invoices

All the information is stored locally into `XDG_DATA_HOME` so you could manually back it up or change things if needed.
